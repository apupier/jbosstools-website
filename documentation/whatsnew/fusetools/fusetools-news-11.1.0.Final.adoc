== REST Viewer becoming an editor

Previously, there was a REST editor which was read-only. It is useful to have a great overview of already defined Camel REST DSL definitions. Now the editor and its related properties tab are also providing editing capabilities allowing to develop faster.

You can now:

* Create and delete REST Configurations
* Create and delete new REST Elements
* Create and delete new REST Operations
* Edit properties for a selected REST Element in the Properties view
* Edit properties for a selected REST Operation in the Properties view

In addition, we've improved the look and feel by fixing the scrolling capabilities of the REST Element and REST Operations lists.

== Global Beans: improve support for Bean references

It is now possible to set Bean references from User Interface when creating a new Bean:

Editing Bean references is also now available on the properties view when editing an existing Bean:

Additional validation has been added to help users avoid mixing Beans defined with class names and Beans defined referencing other beans.

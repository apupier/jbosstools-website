== Camel context parameters configurable in properties view for Camel version < 2.18

Before Camel 2.18, the Camel catalog is missing information about Camel Context. Fuse Tooling is now providing this missing piece of information and thus allow to edit Camel Context parameters in Properties view like for any other component. It is activated when there is no element selected on the diagram.

== Usability improvement: Progress bar when "Changing the Camel version"

Since Fuse Tooling 10.1.0, it is possible to change the Camel version. In case the Camel version was not cached locally yet and for slow internet connections, this operation can take a while. There is now a progress bar to see the progress.
